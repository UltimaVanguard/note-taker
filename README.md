# Description

  I am creating a simple not taker that you can take notes on as reminders or for review later. You are also able to delete any notes you no longer need.

## Usage
  
  Click the get started button to take you to the notes page. Once there you can click on the Note Title and Note Text areas to add your note. 
  
  If you want to restart the note you can click the clear form in the top right, or save note to save it. 
  
  Any notes you have will be displayed on a list to the left. Clicking on the note text will pull it up on the right and clicking the trash can will delete the note.
